# Todo

## Working on

- [x] Add a layer system to the map, make it modular and easy to work with. (Should be the fix for drawing things on top of each other.) (Finshed note: Work on adding a deleting full layer system.)

- [ ] Add an event system based around functions.

## Ideas

### These things may take a long time to finally be implemented, or may never be implemented.


* Audio system for easy to add sound effects/music
* Map Editor
* Menu system
* Networking
