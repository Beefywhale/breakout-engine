# Breakout

## Information

**This is not in a complete state and is missing alot of features.**

A remake of my unfinished framework/engine, this time using sdl2 for rendering.

(currently only tested and supported on Linux)

Breakout is a rougelike framework/engine built in C++. With the goal of making it easier to make Rougelike games without all the hassle.

## Getting Started

* ## Prerequisites
    (currently only tested on Linux)
    `g++` version 7.0+ and the SDL develpment libraries installed in your default include path, specifically `libSDL2` and `libSDL2-ttf`.

* ## Examples
    The `main-example` is the best for looking at how to use the library/framework in a *general* way.

* ## Building Examples
    The examples can be built by using the `make` command in the example's folder.
    You can also use your own compiler commands in place of `make`.
