# Information
A refactor/remake of my unfinished library/framework, this time using sdl.

Currently only tested and supported on Linux.

Breakout is a rougelike framework/engine built in C++ meant for making it easier to make Rougelike games.


# Getting Started
 * ## Building
    You'll need g++ and the SDL develpment libs installed, specifically libSDL2 and libSDL2-ttf. After that just use make to build the executable, or compile it yourself using your own g++ command.
